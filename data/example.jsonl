It focuses on developing algorithms that can access data and use it to learn for themselves."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Explain supervised learning."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data. The model is trained on input-output pairs, learning to map inputs to correct outputs. Common examples include classification and regression tasks."}]}

ML (Machine Learning) is a subset of AI that focuses on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What's reinforcement learning?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties based on its actions and learns to maximize cumulative reward over time. It's used in robotics, game playing, and autonomous systems."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does neural network training work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Neural network training involves adjusting the network's weights to minimize a loss function. The process uses backpropagation to compute gradients and an optimizer (like Adam or SGD) to update weights. Through many iterations on training data, the network learns to make better predictions."}]}
